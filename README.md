## Pyodide testing

 - [DEMO https://amwam-pyodide-testing.now.sh](https://amwam-pyodide-testing.now.sh)
     - WARNING: Roughly 25MB download

This is not a project intended to be used in a production environment. It was purely for me to experiment with [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/)

Pyodide is a Python scientific stack, compiled to WebAssembly.

It provides transparent conversion of objects between Javascript and Python. When inside a browser, this means Python has full access to the Web APIs.

## Running

The project can be run with

    python server.py

and will be found at http://localhost:8000
